# Amandine translations

Welcome to the github repository for the translations strings of [Amandine](https://discord.io/amandine)</a>

## How can i help you to translate ?

- You need to have a GitHub account.
- You need to know how to fork the repo. If you don't follow [this](https://blog.scottlowe.org/2015/01/27/using-fork-branch-git-workflow/) link.

After all that you have to make a pull request with your changes. Follow [this](https://opensource.com/article/19/7/create-pull-request-github) link to know how to make a pull request.

Make sure you don't change any variable like ``{{error}}``, ``{{permission}}``

Don't change the ``$`` in the usage and examples.

Make sure to put your discord tag in the comment of the pull request to get a ``Translator`` role if you are on the discord server. And maybe you would get some perks at the release date of this update.

Or you can just go to the [crowdin](https://crowdin.com/project/amandine) page to translate more easily.
